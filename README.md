# My scripts

I've grouped the scripts by folders. At the top of each file you will find an explanation
about what the script does and how to use it.

Usually the script will check for proper arguments and that required programs are installed prior to running
the script.

## Run at your own risk

You may brick your system by running those scripts, and thus there is no guarantee that it works on
your system and won't break something. Do take a second and look at what the script actually does,
as well as any paths or utilites it uses to make sure it is adjusted for your situation.

Hopefully you will find them useful!
